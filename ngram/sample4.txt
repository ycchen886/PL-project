Accident of situation rather than its own choice again made Perth a
centre of affairs, when Mar’s melting army lay here through the winter
of 1715, watching King George’s force at Stirling; and the forlorn Old
Pretender reached Scone in time to chill the spirits of his partisans,
already too near freezing-point. Prince Charlie made a more dashing
appearance at Perth for a few days; but when he had marched on, the
douce burghers let it be seen that their hearts did not go with him.
They more warmly received the Duke of Cumberland, as representing the
orderly settlement that was good for trade. The wild Highlandman, with
his uncanny weapons and his unbusiness-like sentiments, was here looked
on as suspiciously as the Red Indian warrior in a border city of
America, who in New York or Philadelphia would draw more sympathy or
staring curiosity. The Fair City, while willing to keep friends with the
Tory lairds whose names have been familiar to her for centuries, cast
her douce vote for prosperity and progress. In the Georgian age she
gained some such reputation as Norwich in England, cultivating arts and
letters as well as trade, and becoming known, in a modest way, by her
printing presses, of which the _Encyclopædia Perthensis_ was the most
notable production.
