<s> Accident of situation rather than its own choice again made Perth a centre of affairs , when Mar’s melting army lay here through the winter of 1715 , watching King George’s force at Stirling ; and the forlorn Old Pretender reached Scone in time to chill the spirits of his partisans , already too near freezing-point . <m> Prince Charlie made a more dashing appearance at Perth for a few days ; but when he had marched on , the douce burghers let it be seen that their hearts did not go with him . <m> They more warmly received the Duke of Cumberland , as representing the orderly settlement that was good for trade . <m> The wild Highlandman , with his uncanny weapons and his unbusiness-like sentiments , was here looked on as suspiciously as the Red Indian warrior in a border city of America , who in New York or Philadelphia would draw more sympathy or staring curiosity . <m> The Fair City , while willing to keep friends with the Tory lairds whose names have been familiar to her for centuries , cast her douce vote for prosperity and progress . <m> In the Georgian age she gained some such reputation as Norwich in England , cultivating arts and letters as well as trade , and becoming known , in a modest way , by her printing presses , of which the _ Encyclopædia Perthensis _ was the most notable production . <e>
